# Cerffy

Cerffy is my personal music app, created to integrate with my private Navidrome server. After testing several apps made for Subsonic/Navidrome servers and not adapting to any of them, I decided to develop my own — fully aligned with the experience and interface I wanted.

> **Note:** Cerffy is still under development and there are no public builds available. The app is also not published on any stores. Only I and a few close friends use it, but the source code is open for anyone who wants to explore, make suggestions, or fork.

## Why does Cerffy exist?

- I didn't like the out-of-the-box solutions for Navidrome/Subsonic.
- I wanted to learn more about modern mobile development with React Native/Expo.
- I preferred to build a more intuitive interface in my own way.
- Direct integration with my (private) music server.

## Technologies

- **TypeScript**
- **React Native** (with Expo Go)
- **Tabs** navigation
- Full focus on integration with Navidrome
