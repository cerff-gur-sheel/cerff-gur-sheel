## Who am I?

I'm someone who actually understands computing - from Von Neumann architecture and graph theory to soldering circuits and deploying my own cloud infrastructure. I don't specialize because specialization is for insects. I understand the fundamentals, so I adapt.

**Things I've done:**
- RPA automation
- Game development  
- Networking and cybersecurity
- Hardware repair (fun fact: I could swap phone screens in 12-15 minutes while the "professionals" took 20+)
- DevOps and infrastructure
- Built and maintain my own homelab
- Self-hosted cloud services
- Currently building my own music streaming app connected to my own music server

I run **Arch Linux** (btw) with KDE Plasma and believe in KISS and Clean Code principles. If your code needs 50 comments to be understood, you wrote it wrong.

## Philosophy

I care about **how** things work, not just that they work. I love algorithms, paradigms, and the theoretical beauty of computer science. But I also love getting my hands dirty with real implementations - because theory without practice is just philosophy, and practice without theory is just trial and error.

## Tech Stack

I don't have a "tech stack". I have **understanding**. Give me a problem, I'll learn what's needed and solve it. That's what being a computer scientist means.

But if you really need labels: C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, C, Python (big deal, even my grandpa knows Python), Linux, networking, security, automation, cloud infrastructure, hardware, and whatever else the problem requires.
